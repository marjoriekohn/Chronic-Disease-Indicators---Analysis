## Overview of Chronic Disease Indicators

The raw dataset contains 309,215 observations and 34 variables, including 18 character, 10 logical, and 6 numeric fields. Notably, all 10 logical variables have 0% completeness, suggesting that these fields are placeholders or contain no recorded data. Several variables also exhibit partial completeness, including two character variables and four numeric variables.

### Character Variables:

-   `DataValueFootnote` is 33% complete, containing explanatory text that clarifies data suppression or reporting limitations.
-   `DataValueFootnoteSymbol` is 33% complete, representing the corresponding footnote symbols.

Upon further inspection, rows that contain information in the `DataValueFootnote` column contain one of the following messages:

-   "Data suppressed; too few respondents or cases"
-   "No data available"
-   "Data suppressed; denominator \< 50 or relative standard error \> 30%"
-   "No data available for this indicator because the module was not used by the state or territory"
-   "Data cannot be calculated"
-   "The state registry opted not to present state-specific estimates for this race/ethnicity group"
-   "Interpret with caution: 95% confidence interval width is greater than 20 percentage points"
-   "Interpret with caution; less than 60 respondents"
-   "Estimate is 0.0% because no cases were reported with this condition"

Because these footnotes denote missing, suppressed, or unreliable measurements, all rows containing non-empty values in the `DataValueFootnote` column will be excluded during cleaning to ensure data quality.

### Numeric Variables:

-   `DataValue` is 67% complete, representing quantitative measures such as prevalence rates (e.g., 14.7).
-   `DataValueAlt` is 67% complete, a numeric version of `DataValue`.
-   `LowConfidenceLimit` and `HighConfidenceLimit` are each 61% complete, representing the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval for `DataValue`.

Overall, the dataset is relatively complete, with most missingness concentrated in metadata fields and confidence interval estimates. Addressing these gaps will be an essential part of the data cleaning process to ensure valid interpretations in subsequent analyses and visualizations.
