# Analysis of U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) Dataset
This repository contains an analysis of the [U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI)](https://data.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators/hksd-2xuw/about_data) dataset, which provides valuable insights into the prevalence and impact of chronic diseases across the United States. The analysis aims to identify trends, disparities, and potential areas for public health intervention.

## U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) Dataset
This dataset is maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was developed to inform public health policy by tracking a wide range of chronic health conditions and their associated risk factors. The CDI program consolidates data from multiple federal and state sources to provide a standardized set of measures for both national and state-level analysis. It offers a longitudinal view from 2015 to 2022, covering all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.

## Dataset Structure
The indicators are organized into 21 major topic areas (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer) each containing specific, measurable subcategories. For example, within the Cardiovascular Disease topic, the “diseases of the heart mortality” indicator reports mortality rates from death certificates collected through the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). The dataset also includes information on key behavioral and socioeconomic drivers of chronic disease, such as tobacco use and economic stability. This comprehensive structure allows researchers to consistently monitor trends and identify disparities across locations and populations.
